# Summary niners-nfl-predictions
analyzing NFL stats using data science and python libraries to predict 49ers 2022 season wins

NFL data was taken from Pro Football reference: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/

## Hands on Practice with data science using machine learning and statistical tools
Practiced how to manipulate NFL stats data by:
* visualizing game stats using libraries
* model stats choosing features used to predict winning games
* tune model to improve accuracy by manipulating test data size
* discover which stat features are most influential to determine wins


## Libraries
* matplotlib, pandas and numpy: used to create bar graphs in visualizing data in python
* seaborn: visualizing statistical graphs attractively
* sklearn: machine learning open source data analysis and statistical modeling in python
* requests: enables sending HTTP requests via python
* bs4: pulling data out of HTML/XML files
